<p>The Australian and New Zealand School for Ultracold Physics (ANZSUP) is a graduate summer/winter school aimed at Master level and beginning PhD students. The School focuses on the field of ultra-cold physics &mdash; the science of temperatures below that of outer space, where quantum mechanics rules. It was launched in 2011 as the Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Physics (VSSUP) by Professor Peter Drummond and colleagues and was held three times on the campus of Swinburn University of Technology in Melbourne, Victoria. In 2015 the School moved to New Zealand with a new name: ANZSUP. The last edition of ANZSUP was held in January 2019 in Dunedin, New Zealand. Future editions of ANZSUP will be announced on this web site.</p>

        <p>ANZSUP 2019 was a blast. Thanks to everyone who participated and contributed! ANZSUP 2019 was held in Dunedin on the South Island of New Zealand late January as a one-week summer school aimed at Master level and beginning PhD students. 2019 topics ranged from laser trapping and cooling of ultra-cold atoms through atom optics, magnetism in spinor Bose gases, to stochastic differential equations and the interplay of quantum physics with general relativity.</p>

        <h3>November 30th &ndash; December 11th</h3>

        <p>The inaugural Australian and New Zealand School in Ultracold Physics (ANZSUP), under the new name, was held in Dunedin on the South Island of New Zealand in late 2015 as a two-week summer school aimed at Master level and beginning PhD students. The 2015 edition covered topics ranging from laser trapping and cooling of ultra-cold atoms through quantum simulation and open quantum systems, ultra-cold Bose and Fermi gases, optical lattices and many-body systems with disorder, spinor order parameters and long-range interactions, polaritons in semiconductors.</p>

        <h3>January 20th &ndash; January 31st</h3>

        <p>The Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Physics, 2014, was a 9 day summer course of lectures at the postgraduate level, on ultra-cold physics &mdash; the science of temperatures as low as a billionth of one degree above absolute zero. That year, there was a special emphasis on low dimensional systems.</p>

        <p>The inaugural Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Atomic Physics was held in Melbourne over a two week period toward the end of January 2011. The School incorporated approximately 6 lectures per day, and allowed time for additional tutorials and discussions.</p>

        <p>The primary targets for this school were local graduate students, although interstate and international students were more than welcome to attend.</p>

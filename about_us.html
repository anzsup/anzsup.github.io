<h2>About us</h2>
</div>

<p>The Australian and New Zealand School for Ultracold Physics (ANZSUP) is a graduate summer/winter school aimed at Master level and beginning PhD students. The School focuses on the field of ultra-cold physics &mdash; the science of temperatures below that of outer space, where quantum mechanics rules. It was launched in 2011 as the Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Physics (VSSUP) by Professor Peter Drummond and colleagues and was held three times on the campus of Swinburn University of Technology in Melbourne, Victoria. In 2015 the School moves to New Zealand with a new name: ANZSUP.</p>

        <p>The Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Physics, 2014, was a 9 day summer course of lectures at the postgraduate level, on ultra-cold physics &mdash; the science of temperatures as low as a billionth of one degree above absolute zero. That year, there was a special emphasis on low dimensional systems.</p>

        <p>The inaugural Victorian Summer School in Ultracold Atomic Physics was held in Melbourne over a two week period toward the end of January 2011. The School incorporated approximately 6 lectures per day, and allowed time for additional tutorials and discussions.</p>

        <p>The primary targets for this school were local graduate students, although interstate and international students were more than welcome to attend.</p>
